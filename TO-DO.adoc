== Fixes and improvements

- Fix spacing of elipsis.
- Fix colon/semicolon after English uppercase expressions.
- Use always "v." etc to mark the word type. Now the notation is not
  regular.
- Decide about notation "D" and "S", e.g. "leDer", "diagnoSe".
- Homogenize the usage of commas and semicolons.
- Fix "COME ON", which was at the end of "COME", without translation.
- Separate "LIMB membre; tranche; LIMB (astr.) limbe" and similar
  cases.
- Add a list of abbreviations used in the dictionary.
- Homogenize notations v.a./tr. and v.n./intr.
- Separate all variants into independent headwords.
- Fix: "punte" is mentioned in "SCORE", but not in "POINT".
- Fix "TO LOOK UP TO", which was at the end of "LOOK" without
  translation.
- Fix "prep." -> "(prep.)".
- Remove asterisks.
- Improve notation of "OFF"
- Split "DRIFT" into verb and noun.
- Duplicate example expressions as entries. The original does it, e.g.
  "CHEST OF DRAWERS" is an entry, but also part of of "DRAWER". Also
  "INLAID FLOOR".  Candidates: "WHITE OF EGG", "ERE LONG"... 
- Fix "amíco/s", "amíca/s".
- Fix "-eria" -> "-ería".
- FIx "OFF (prep.) for. Also as prefix: forcurrer, forportar = to run,
  carry off".
- Fix : In the original transcription "BOOKMARK" was at the end of
  "BOOK" without translation.
- Fix notation . "AT ONE'S WITS' END esser al fine de su Latin, plu ne
  saver quo far", because the English expression is not a verb.
- Add "(num.)" to "ONE". Maybe other cases.
- "AS LIEF (v.) preferer", "I WOULD AS LIEF yo vell preferer".
- Fix: "ALOUD (adv.) vocosi, con voce, audibilmen". "ALOUD" is adverb,
  but "vocosi" is adjective. -> "vocosimen".
- Fix: FRUMP (n.) oldmodic, feminach, oldmodona". "oldmodic" is not a
  noun.
- Fix: "GIVEN TO inclinat, disposit". The corresponding prepositions
  are missing in Interlingue.
- Fix: "ACCOMPLISHMENT (n.) (aquisit) habilitá". The notation of
  "(aquisit)" is that of the English comments.
- Fix: "GULLIBLE (adj.) (facil) dupabil".  The notation of "(facil)"
  is that of the English comments.
- Separate usages: "ANOTHER (adj. pron.) altri, ancor un".
- Fix: "ARRANT archi-"
- "ANALOGY analog (-ie)". "ANALOGY" is noun, but "analog" is
  adjective.
- "CLIEUT clieut (-ela)" -> "CLIENT".
- In "GLIB (tro) fluent; suavi" "(tro)" is Interlingue, but uses the
  notation of English comments.
- In "JINGLE (far) tintinar" "(far)" is Interlingue, but uses the
  notation of English comments.
- Use notation "(expr.)" for sentences.
- "POLICY (plan) plan de action; (politics) political; (insur.)
  police". "political" -> "politica".
- "YODEL (sons) yodle (-ero, -ar)" -> songs
- Change "prefix." -> "prefix"/"pref.".
- Fix: "STILL ancor" is missing. "ancor" is mentioned only in "YET".
- Add adv. usages to "NEVERTHELESS" and "HOWEVER".
- "YORE" is missing.
- Fix: "PASS AWAY|v.|morir; evanescer|" -> "PASS AWAY|v.|morir|",
  "PASS OUT|v.|evanescer|"

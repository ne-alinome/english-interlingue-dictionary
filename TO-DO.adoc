== Fixes and improvements

- Convert "...." (the last one in an actual dot) to "….".
- Fix spacing of elipsis.
- Fix: in "SELF", "SELFWILL" lacks translation.
- Fix colon/semicolon after English uppercase expressions.
- Use always "v." etc to mark the word type. Now the notation is not
  regular.
- Decide about notation "D" and "S", e.g. "leDer", "diagnoSe".
- Homogenize the usage of commas and semicolons.
- Fix "COME ON", which was at the end of "COME", without translation.

  cases.

- Fix: "punte" is mentioned in "SCORE", but not in "POINT".
- Fix "TO LOOK UP TO", which was at the end of "LOOK" without
  translation.
- Fix "prep." -> "(prep.)".
- Remove asterisks.
- Improve notation of "OFF"
- Split "DRIFT" into verb and noun.
- Duplicate example expressions as entries. The original does it, e.g.
  "CHEST OF DRAWERS" is an entry, but also part of of "DRAWER". Also
  "INLAID FLOOR".  Candidates: "WHITE OF EGG", "ERE LONG"... 
- Fix "amíco/s", "amíca/s".
- Fix "-eria" -> "-ería".
- FIx "OFF (prep.) for. Also as prefix: forcurrer, forportar = to run,
  carry off".

  "foot- (2)" without translation.
- Fix : In the original transcription "BOOKMARK" was at the end of
  "BOOK" without translation.

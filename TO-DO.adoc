== Fixes and improvements

- Join phrasal verbs and their root headword.
- Fix spacing of elipsis.
- Fix: in "SELF", "SELFWILL" lacks translation.
- Fix colon/semicolon after English uppercase expressions.
- Convert headwords with asterisk.
- Use always "v." etc to mark the word type. Now the notation is not
  regular.
- Decide about notation "D" and "S", e.g. "leDer", "diagnoSe".
- Homogenize the usage of commas and semicolons.
- Fix "COME ON", which was at the end of "COME", without translation.
- Homogenize notation "1.", "2." etc. in descriptions. Separate into
  different entries.
- Separate "LIMB membre; tranche; LIMB (astr.) limbe" and similar
  cases.
- Add a list of abbreviations used in the dictionary.
- Homogenize notations v.a./tr. and v.n./intr.
- Separate all variants into independent headwords.
- Fix: "punte" is mentioned in "SCORE", but not in "POINT".
- Fix: "bock" -> "book".

== Doubts

- Confirm "apsorter".
- Confirm entry "fro, to and". 
- Confirm "BEATITUD beatitá. BEATITUDES: \~".
- Confirm "INTESTINE\~ (-al); (the small) ileum". The small intestine
  consists of three parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
- Confirm: comma before "etc".
- Confirm certain compound headwors, e.g. "GOOD-FELLOWSHIP".
- Confirm "PLATING, ARMOUR * curasse" is "PLATING or ARMOUR" ("ARMOUR"
  already has its own entry) or "ARMOUR PLATING".
- Confirm  "TO GET OFF SCOT FREE: escapar sin vúlneres".
- Confirm and fix "blond(a)" -> "a. blond; n. blonda".
- Consult "ebri, ebriat (in-ar)".

  against. [Archaic & Colloq.] [1913 Webster]".
- Consult "rococo/ó"
- Consult "CIRCUMAMBIENT".
- Consult "LEGERDEMAIN jongleríe, escamotage. LEGERDEMAINLEGGED:
  -gambat"
- Consult "HATCH OUT: covar, inventer; (in drawing) *sgraffir"
- Consult about compound headwords like "WELL-BEING" and many others.
- Consult "ENTHUSIASM = entusiasme (-ar, -ast, -astic)".
- Confirm "UNLESS = si...ne"
- Confirm and homogenize notations "(v.a)/(v.n)" and "(tr.)/(intr.)".
- Consult: Make one-word expressions independent headwords: SOUPTERN
  from SOUP, SOLOIST from SOLO, SOLDIERY from SOLDIER, HELPFULLESS
  from HELPFUL, HIMSELF from HIM...
- Consult: Move headwords that contain spaces into other headwords.
